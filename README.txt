# YGOPro-Decklist-Project

Accurate character anime/manga/movie decks. Including Structure/Starter decks for YGOPro 

As a disclaimer I do not own nor am I affiliated with Konami, Bandai, or the people behind YGOPro. I am simply a passionate fan who wishes to lessen the hassle of decks reflecting the various mediums Yu-Gi-Oh! has been produced in. Please support official Yu-Gi-Oh! content.

Finished and Optimized Decks

z0.SD.1999.EX.Kaiba
z1.SD.2000.EX-R.Kaiba
z1.SD.2000.EX-R.Yugi
Note: Only difference between the EX and EX-R decks is the addition of card destruction and soul exchange. I added both cards to the Kaiba and Yugi EX-R decks.
