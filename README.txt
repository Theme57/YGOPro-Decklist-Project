# YGOPro-Decklist-Project

Accurate character anime/manga/movie decks. Including Structure/Starter decks for YGOPro 

As a disclaimer I do not own nor am I affiliated with Konami, Toei Animation, or the people behind YGOPro. I am simply a passionate fan who wishes to lessen the hassle of decks reflecting the various mediums Yu-Gi-Oh! has been produced in. Please support official Yu-Gi-Oh! content.
