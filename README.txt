# YGOPro-Decklist-Project

Accurate character anime/manga/movie decks. Including Structure/Starter decks for YGOPro 

The rules I’ve set for myself are the following
1)	Main decks will be constructed based upon the overall season and arc they appeared in for a particular character. Side decks will reflect changes/additions characters make to their decks during a particular arc/movie/etc. 
2)	Character decks will be built using cards they’ve used and seen owning. Kaiba and Yugi with near unlimited access to cards may be limited to just cards they’ve used. Specific rules of the arc (duelist kingdom, battle city, etc.) will have the card for those rules to be put into place. 
3)	Deck size will be between 40 – 45 cards to keep some semblance of consistency and reduce the chance of bricking if the deck is shuffled. Decks explicitly mentioned to have more than this amount may exceed the 45 cards. 
4)	To further avoid bricking, decks will be organized in an optimal way to reflect strategies and play styles used/seen by characters; players must select the ‘do not shuffle deck’ option similar to Duel Generations (non-mobile) story mode decks [only better]. 
5)	If a deck is short the minimum card limit then cards available and/or commonly used cards during that era will be added. IE, a Joey deck is short 5 cards and Red-Eyes support was available at the time, but not used in the deck then I would add the appropriate cards. Same if a deck is short a few cards, I would add generic anime staples such as in DM where most decks use pot of greed, graceful charity and monster reborn. 
6)	I will be organizing the decks via the following. z[chronologic series number/era].[abbreviation of series name (DM for Duel Monsters), MV for movie, MG for manga, and SD for Structure/Starter Deck][chronological number].[abbreviation of season title or year the structure/starter deck was released].[Primary English Name]-[Primary Japanese Name]. While somewhat complex it will keep everything in proper order and avoid having battle city decks show up before duelist kingdom ones. 
Limitations
1)	I have yet to try to code cards, not all cards shown in the anime have their respective anime effects in YGOPro. Learning how to code some cards to be like their anime counterpart may be outside of abilities at this time, but would be possible if someone volunteered. 
2)	While the project in of itself is not overly difficult [save for optimizing decks] it still requires commitment and time. I will do my best to see this project through and through.
3)	I have no affiliation or am part of any mod team within the YGOPro community; I am simply a passionate fan. As such, I have no control if YGOPro changes cards or Konami pulls something like Nintendo did with emulation websites. Most of what I can do are bound within the limits of the program, servers and my coding abilities.

As a disclaimer I do not own nor am I affiliated with Konami, Bandai, or the people behind YGOPro. I am simply a passionate fan who wishes to lessen the hassle of decks used by characters in the various mediums Yu-Gi-Oh! has been produced in. Please support official Yu-Gi-Oh! content.

Important Notes
Pilot and DK decks have the Duelist Kingdom card, if you do not wish to play by those rules please put it into the side deck or refuse the prompt. You may opt out by refusing the prompt. If both decks have the card in it and you don't want effect damage to be doubled due to stacking please have 1 person place it in the side deck. 

Finished and Optimized Decks
z0.SD.1999.StarterBox
z0.SD.1999.EX.Yugi
z0.SD.1999.EX.Kaiba
z1.SD.2000.EX-R.Kaiba
z1.SD.2000.EX-R.Yugi
Note: Only difference between the EX and EX-R decks is the addition of card destruction and soul exchange. I added both cards to the Kaiba and Yugi EX-R decks.
z1.DM1.Pilot.Kaiba
z1.DM1.Pilot.Solomon-Sugoroku
Note: I chose Pilot as the season name despite the first episode being part of the DK arc. Also while Yugi faces Kaiba on screen he is in fact using Solomon's deck. Also these decks and all decks until the battle city arc will require the duelist kingdom card mod
